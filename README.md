# CS-255
The DriverPass project was about making a system for the business, who wanted to improve driver training with online classes and tests. Our job was to plan things like appointments, reservations, security, and how the system looks. We were really good at understanding exactly what the business needed, like online bookings and user roles, which made our design unique.

I would make one part better by explaining more about how each design feature helps users. This would make things clearer and show how our ideas match what the client wanted. We understood Driverpass's ideas, analyzed them, and turned them into system features. Designing for users means making a system that works the way they want and need.

When I design software, I always think about what users want. I talk to business, find out what they need, and make plans based on that. I use methods like making simple drawings, trying things out, and talking to others to make sure the design is good. I also listen to feedback and change things if needed, to make sure the design keeps getting better.
